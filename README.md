Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a given key.

Features Encrypt plain text with a custom shift value Decrypt ciphertext back to plain text Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters Ignores non-alphabetic characters (keeps spaces, numbers, symbols unchanged) Simple command-line interface

How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest forms of encryption. Each letter in the text is replaced by another letter that is a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

Example (shift = 3):

Plaintext: HELLO Ciphertext: KHOOR
